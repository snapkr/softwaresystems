Homework:

P-2.2
Because the queries have no side-effect, meaning that they can't change the state of the object.

P-2.4
???

P-2.10
In: Safe		74%
		All. public Safe {} and asserts only a few times.
	Password	47%
		only constructor and acceptable have been used.
		
	If some cases only have 0% they are not tested, and a separate test case should be created.
	
P-2.11

due to assert code.length() <= 6 : "Entered password is to short"; i get a assert error.
-ea = enableassertions
It causes executing the assert():  statments in my code, wich otherwise would be skipped.They cause some extra checking during runtime.
